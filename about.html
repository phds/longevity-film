          <div class='text_block'> Human lifespans are increasing significantly due to exponential advances in science and technology, meaning we can live longer, healthier lives. But this extended lifespan comes at a price and it is no accident; we must now work to sustain ourselves until we’re very old, retirement becoming a distant, perhaps non-existent, prospect. With a fear of death having already been culturally, socially and historically constructed, where we desire a longer life to outrun death for as long as possible, we fall into the trap ourselves. In result, we are being bred like dairy cows to work like dairy cows by those who govern us, feeding and fuelling an outdated capitalist industrial system.

           Through a documentary film and interactive installation, my project aims to provide new images and stories for political discourse, using conspiracy as a tool for critical thinking in a post-truth world. By addressing these issues and raising awareness to them, I explore a future of work where post-capitalism reigns, universal basic income is widespread, automation proliferates, and “work” is reduced to finding comfort in typing on a screen - giving away data to fulfil an innate human urge to be functional or feel of some purpose.

           The main question thus remains: what becomes of human existence when work may no longer be the main determiner of wealth and prosperity in society?
